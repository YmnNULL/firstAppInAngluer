                    This project marks my very first experience with the Angular framework, and it represents a major
                    milestone
                    in my journey to becoming a professional web developer. I started with a blank slate, determined not
                    just to
                    build something that works, but to truly understand how Angular applications are structured and how
                    their
                    different parts come together.

                    Every file I created and every line of code I wrote was part of a learning process focused on
                    writing clean,
                    maintainable, and scalable code. One of the key concepts I explored in this project was Angular's
                    powerful
                    routing system. Learning how to set up routes allowed me to create a single-page application (SPA)
                    that
                    feels fast and responsive.

                    I built multiple pages such as a home page, about page, and contact page, all connected through the
                    Angular
                    Router without the need for full page reloads. It gave me a real taste of how professional websites
                    manage
                    seamless navigation behind the scenes. I also worked extensively with components, which are the
                    building
                    blocks of any Angular application.

                    I broke the UI down into smaller, reusable components like a header, footer, and individual page
                    views. This
                    modular structure helped me better understand how to design scalable applications. This project is
                    more than
                    just a simple demo — it's a foundation I’m building upon as I grow in the world of front-end
                    development.
